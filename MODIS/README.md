# Do internals of neural networks make sense in the context of hydrology?

This folder contains a R script to download and preprocess MODIS data of snow-cover-fraction and evapotranspiration for each basin. The code is provided for transparency, since the resulting data is published as well in the [code/data](../code/data) folder.

The corresponding author for this script is Mathew Herrnegger. For question please contact him (email contact provided in the R script.)
